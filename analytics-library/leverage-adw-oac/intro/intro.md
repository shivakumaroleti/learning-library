## Introduction

The following hands-on workshop will walk through users connecting **Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** to **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**, getting immediate valuable insight out of your ADW data, scaling up ADB database to optimize OAC performance, deepening analysis by mashing-up additional data and leveraging OAC interactive visualization features.

This workshop is based on "**OAC+ADW Workshop**" from [Oracle Analytics Library](https://www.oracle.com/business-analytics/data-visualization/tutorials.html), Tutorials tab.

You can also leverage the 2 corresponding videos "**Oracle Analyitics Cloud + ADWC Simple Workshop**"

**Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** delivers a self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet demands. The service supports two workload types:

- **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)** provides an autonomous warehousing environment, associated with fast query performance

- **Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP)** provides an autonomous online transaction processing and mixed workload environment

For the purpose of this workshop, we will use **ADW** so all the steps will be related to this database service.

**Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** is a scalable and secure public cloud service that provides a full set of capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics for you, your workgroup, and your enterprise.

With **Oracle Analytics Cloud**, you also get flexible service management capabilities, including fast setup, easy scaling and patching, and automated lifecycle management.

To run the workshop, you will need an [_Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account_](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) with a provisioned ADW instance and a a provisioned OAC instance. This pre-requisite guide will take you step-by-step through how to get the account and set the instance up, to be ready to start the workshop.
